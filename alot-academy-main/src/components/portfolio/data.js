    body: "We used Figma for the sketch to expedite decision-making while maintaining efficiency. The design process was initiated with low-fidelity sketches and wireframes. These visualizations were informed by the initial user interviews, the project's business objectives, and a heuristic evaluation. This approach allowed us to assess and validate design concepts and user flows before finalizing any specific direction.",

    heading: "High fidelity wireframe",
    body: "After checking out similar products and taking a deep dive into our mood board for inspiration, we used Figma to translate the sketches into high-fidelity wireframes. Then, we improved them by adding text, colors, images, icons, and CTA buttons. Since we were designing a health app, we worked with shades of white and blue. These colors connote cleanliness and are associated with health. We only designed the light theme of the product and chose to use a light grey background to make the visual look like steel. At this stage, the wireframes were defined enough for some user testing. Based on some tests, we made a few alterations and moved on to adding interactions on Figma.",
